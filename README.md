# Gulp with browsersync and sass pre-configured
This repository contains Gulp (build tool/taskrunner) including a complete setup of browsersync and sass.

## Installation
Run `npm install` command to install all necessary dependencies.
Otherwise Gulp will **not** work, and as a result browsersync and sass to css compilation will not run either.

## Usage
| Goal                                                  | Command    |
|-------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Run browsersync (auto reload) and automatic sass to css compilation | gulp watch |
| Compile sass to css **only**                          | gulp comp  |
